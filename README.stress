Stress tool brief description

1) Compile OMS:

$ ./configure
$ make all

2) Edit stress.cfg. Refer to comments in this file. For example:

[main]
loglevel = 4
logfile = stress.log
server = localhost
port = 1935
type = rtmp
connection_speed = 200
connection_lifetime = 600
connection_number = 10
app_name = jingleserv
behaviour = publisher-subscriber
publish_rate = 65/32

This will start a connection to rtmp://localhost:1935/jingleserv every
200 milliseconds until 10 connections will be established.
Every connection will be active within 600 seconds.
The behaviour is 'publisher-subscriber' which means there will be started
5 pairs of connections (10/2 = 5) which will exchange traffic between each
other at rate 65 bytes per 32 milliseconds. The log level is 4 (Info)
and log file is stress.log.

3) run stress tool:

$ ./omsctl stress

Make sure that an RMTP server is already running before. See README.

4) to stop it just type Ctrl+C.
